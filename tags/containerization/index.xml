&lt;p>Developing software and applications is getting more complex day by day. This introduces the complexity of running and deploying the applications in different machines or environments. It also includes making sure it works everywhere no matter what the architecture of the host machine is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Applications running in the same environment can conflict with other applications. This can cause malfunctions and make application development less effective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To solve this problem we need isolation and a virtual machine is one way to achieve this. We can have different virtual machines to run the applications that will be independent of other applications environments.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
