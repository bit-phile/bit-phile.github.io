Hello folks! Good to see you again on our journey of Docker. In this post, we would be learning about docker networking. So, let's get started.

## Abstract

Docker has been a powerful tool for creating and managing independent applications and services. These services are interacting with each through specified interfaces. However, the isolated environment of docker stymies that interaction. An isolated environment hinders services communications by request-response mechanism as they have different network namespaces.

To solve this problem, docker introduced the concept of networking. Docker Networking.

## Problem without networking

Applications are running in their containers. These containers have their networking interfaces, namespace, etc. They are not aware of other containers. If there is an application that wants to communicate with another application, sends a request to a specified endpoint of another application. The request never reaches another application as networks are different and isolated.

For example, consider a chat application `feeberchat` (I created this app a long time ago üòÑ). `feeberchat` is running inside a container `A`. The database of `feeberchat` is getting stored in an instance of `mongodb` running inside another container `B`.

As both `A` and `B` have different network namespaces, they can't communicate.

## How does Docker Networking solve the problem?

Docker networking allows to create isolated networks for containers to communicate with each other. It creates a common networking namespace where containers reside and communicate. 

![Docker with networking](/tech/docker/docker-with-networking.png "Docker with networking for containers A and B")


## An example

Assume we have a node (express) application running on port `3000`, dockerized with endpoints:
1. `/`
2. `/health`

Running that application in no network using

```shell
‚ü© docker run -d --name express-app --network none bitphile/express-app       (base)
```

Let's try to access it from another container.

```shell
‚ü© docker run -it --rm --name alpine-shell alpine:latest sh       (base)
```

It opens up the container. Now we have to send a request to container `express-app`. What is the endpoint? We don't know as `express-app` is running without any network. Docker didn't assign any IP address to `express-app` container. 

Now, let's run `express-app` again differently

```shell
‚ü© docker run -d --name express-app bitphile/express-app                (base)
```

Inspecting network details of `express-app` gives

```json
{
  "bridge": {
    "IPAMConfig": null,
    "Links": null,
    "Aliases": null,
    "NetworkID": "8f7326c66c80c45501e24eb7c29596b9a1065624a81b443ef34f8e5c59abab05",
    "EndpointID": "987f33191fc7843190ac74227c8d062b6a8e2b9c2101e52e289f2f82e6f8c9af",
    "Gateway": "172.17.0.1",
    "IPAddress": "172.17.0.3",
    "IPPrefixLen": 16,
    "IPv6Gateway": "",
    "GlobalIPv6Address": "",
    "GlobalIPv6PrefixLen": 0,
    "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:11:00:03",
    "DriverOpts": null
  }
}

```

It bombarded us with a bunch of details. Let's not worry about the rest of the details and take `IPAddress` into consideration. `IPAdderss` is the IP address of container `express-app` in the `default bridge` network (coming in the following sections. Just assume it is as a networking type).

Let's send a request to this ip address from `alpine-shell` container.

```shell
$ curl 172.17.0.3:3000/health
This is healthy $
```

Great! We got some results. 

### What did happen?

When we run `express-app` container without specifying `--network` flag, it creates a virtual network (which is called `default bridge` network). Docker assigns an ip address from that virtual network to the container. That's why we could see `IPAddress`  in docker inspect. 

If you try running `express-app` with `--network none` flag and inspect the container, you wouldn't be seeing any network information.

![Default bridge networking](/tech/docker/docker-default-bridge.png)

## Network drivers

Docker provides various network drivers for different types of requirements. Following is a list of those drivers.

1. bridge
2. host
3. overlay
4. macvlan
5. ipvlan

Each of these drivers has different capabilities. Select a driver best suits your requirements. For the sake of simplicity and the size of the post, we would be going with `bridge` network driver.

## Bridge Networks

Aligning ourselves with the name, we can think of a bridge as something that connects segments. In networking, it is a Link Layer device that connects network segments. 

In docker, bridge networks connect containers in a network where they can communicate easily while allowing isolation from the rest of the containers not connected to the same bridge network.

Bridge networks can only be used on the **same** docker daemon host. For networking among containers from different docker hosts, prefer some other docker networking driver (eg [overlay network](https://docs.docker.com/network/overlay/)).

### Default Bridge Network

Docker creates this network by default if we don't specify any network to use.

```shell
‚ü© docker network ls                                                              (base)
NETWORK ID     NAME         DRIVER    SCOPE
8f7326c66c80   bridge       bridge    local
1b69478406e4   host         host      local
9324e36db9ab   none         null      local
```

Look `bridge` network of the driver `bridge`. This is the default bridge network created and managed by docker. Though we can also configure it but not doing also suffices the requirements in most cases.

> Note: Have a look at `none` network with `null` driver. This is what we have used for no networking.

### User-defined Bridge Network

We can also create a network of driver `bridge`. This has a few advantages over `default bridge` network:
1. The most important, user-defined bridge network provides **automatic DNS resolution between containers**. It means, we can directly use container names to send requests instead of IP addresses.
2. User has total control over the configurations on the network.
3. Only containers with this network type can communicate.

### Using user-defined Bridge Network

#### Creating a network

Following is the command used to create a docker network
```shell
docker network create [options] <name>
```

Let's create a network of the name `bitphile`.

```shell
‚ü© docker network create bitphile                                                (base)
2bfb26180adc42445ca0127f8628d45b71f1871b8b3fdea2a7d3da8b31e9dd17
‚ü© docker network ls                                                             (base)
NETWORK ID     NAME       DRIVER    SCOPE
2bfb26180adc   bitphile   bridge    local
8f7326c66c80   bridge     bridge    local
1b69478406e4   host       host      local
9324e36db9ab   none       null      local
```

By default, it creates a network of driver type `bridge`. We can specify the driver using `--driver` flag.
```shell
‚ü© docker network create --driver macvlan bitphile                               (base)
237a35cfa290dd59db70b099cf970efd5efbd29f150ae65c7add51632d704a81
```

Inspecting the network details gives us
```json
[
    {
        "Name": "bitphile",
        "Id": "2bfb26180adc42445ca0127f8628d45b71f1871b8b3fdea2a7d3da8b31e9dd17",
        "Created": "2023-03-19T09:42:37.48139717Z",
        "Scope": "local",
        "Driver": "bridge",
        "EnableIPv6": false,
        "IPAM": {
            "Driver": "default",
            "Options": {},
            "Config": [
                {
                    "Subnet": "172.20.0.0/16",
                    "Gateway": "172.20.0.1"
                }
            ]
        },
        "Internal": false,
        "Attachable": false,
        "Ingress": false,
        "ConfigFrom": {
            "Network": ""
        },
        "ConfigOnly": false,
        "Containers": {},
        "Options": {},
        "Labels": {}
    }
]
```

Running the container with this network

```shell
‚ü© docker run -d --name express-app --network bitphile bitphile/express-app
70ae390032cbf2e1e38e749895cf17533c70021168a457480a3dd57f035296fe
```

If we inspect the network `bitphile` again, we would see a list of containers using this network.

```json
[
    {
        "Name": "bitphile",
        "Id": "56b7da97479a3a27859e2c62b5a9f84b8389b5b3d5b41b40283b56a40e88d1a6",
        "Created": "2023-03-19T09:46:13.74404902Z",
        "Scope": "local",
        "Driver": "bridge",
        "EnableIPv6": false,
        "IPAM": {
            "Driver": "default",
            "Options": {},
            "Config": [
                {
                    "Subnet": "172.22.0.0/16",
                    "Gateway": "172.22.0.1"
                }
            ]
        },
        "Internal": false,
        "Attachable": false,
        "Ingress": false,
        "ConfigFrom": {
            "Network": ""
        },
        "ConfigOnly": false,
        "Containers": {
            "70ae390032cbf2e1e38e749895cf17533c70021168a457480a3dd57f035296fe": {
                "Name": "express-app",
                "EndpointID": "0fda9ef2aa92e5966320c330776986c9cea15210354d2994e3060522619a5290",
                "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:16:00:02",
                "IPv4Address": "172.22.0.2/16",
                "IPv6Address": ""
            }
        },
        "Options": {},
        "Labels": {}
    }
]
```

#### Quick introduction to subnet and gateway

This won't be thorough. It would just be for understanding networking in the context of docker. 

##### Subnet

It is used to divide the larger network into the smaller network to make network management easy. For example, subnet `172.22.0.0/16`  means the first `16 bites` will be used for networks, and the rest of `16 bits` will be used for hosts in the sub-network.

```plain text

172    22    0    0
 -------      ----
 network      host
```

In the context of docker, the subnet makes sure that the network interface has a unique IP address (gateway IP address) and the containers are assigned unique IP addresses. It also helps in routing traffic.

##### Gateway

As the name suggests, it is the entry point (and exit point) of a network segment. 

In the context of docker, we have gateway `172.22.0.1` which is an entry point for network `bitphile`. 

#### Specifying subnet and gateway

It is possible to provide a subnet and gateway while creating a network.

```shell
‚ü© docker network create --subnet=172.20.0.0/16 --gateway=172.20.0.1 bitphile  (base)
340e9f5c82185940df2a3a2009e6ef5276c1c6b440a9a8dc5376c5c5df448b90
```

Try running the same command again and see what happens.

You can't create another network with the subnet already used.

#### Delete a network

Deleting something gives such a relaxation that can't be expressed. Specially deleting the code (don't delete a working code üòÇ).

We can delete the network using

```shell
‚ü© docker network rm bitphile                                                    (base)
bitphile
```
