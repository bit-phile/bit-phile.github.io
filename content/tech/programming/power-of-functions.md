## What is a function ?

What is a function? Think about it. I am sure what thought is revolving around your mind. That thought must be "A function is something that does something and can be reused again." 

Well, it makes sense as from the college we are getting taught about it this way. However, what do you think about this statement, "A function is something which is used as a placeholder for something." ? You must be wandering what is that **something**. This **something** in this context can an expression or a unit of work.

Let's take an example,

```
f(x) = x * 4
```

When we do,

```
f(2)
// it gets replaced with
=> (x * 4) (2) // x is 2
=> (2 * 4)
=> 8
```

Just a question for you. Why do you make functions in first place? Please provide your answers in comments below.
